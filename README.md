# OpenClassrooms - Python Developer Path

**Project 9:** Develop a Web Application Using Django

**Student:** Abdoul Baki Seydou

**Date:** 04/11/2023

# Abstract
This project consists of developing for the up-and-coming startup, LITReview, a secure web app that will allow users 
to request and publish reviews of books and articles.

The website will be created using the Django framework, as an MVP (minimum viable product). 
The focus will therefore be more on the backend. 
The frontend will be a clean and minimal UI matching the wireframes provided and allowing user to:

  -	Sign up and log in.
  -	View a feed - with the latest on top - containing:
    - their own tickets and reviews,
    - any reviews in response to their own tickets,
    - the tickets and reviews from users that they follow.
  -	Create new tickets requesting a review of a book/article.
  -	Create reviews in response to created tickets.
  -	Create a ticket then a review as part of one-step process.
  -	View, edit, and delete their own tickets and reviews.
  -	Follow other users by entering their username.
  -	View who they follow and unfollow whoever they want. 

This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python languages.

# Requirement

Latest version of Python must be installed.

You can download the latest version for your system from : https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Installation

The following commands rely on the knowledge of how to use the terminal (Unix, macOS) or the command line (Windows).

**1 - Get the code**

  * $ git clone https://github.com/Afudu/P9_OpenClassroom.git

**2 - Move to the folder**

  * Unix/macOS/Windows: cd P9_OpenClassroom

**3 - Create a virtual environment**

  * Unix/macOS: $ python3 -m venv pythonenv
  * Windows: py -m venv pythonenv
  
    * Note: you can create the virtual environment in another folder, then move to that folder to run the command above.
    * Example: in the above command, our virtual environment created is called pythonenv - you can give a different name.

**4 - Activate the virtual environment created**

  * Unix/macOS: $ source pythonenv/bin/activate

  * Windows: pythonenv\Scripts\activate

**5 - Securely upgrade pip**

 * Unix/macOS/Windows: pip install --upgrade pip

**6 - Install all dependencies**

 * Unix/macOS/Windows: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the application

In the terminal (Unix, macOS) or command line (Windows):

**1 - Move to the LITReview folder:** cd LITReview

**2 - Start the server:** python manage.py runserver


# Testing the application
After the server has started, to access the website, navigate to the url: http:/127.0.0.1:8000/

For testing the website and its functionalities as detailed in the project specification documents, 
there are three user accounts created: John, Marga and Tibou.
The password for each user is: Password.01

# PEP 8 adherence
The folder 'flake_report' in the repository contains an HTML report generated by flake8-html which displays no errors.
A new report can be generated by running the following command in the terminal (Unix, macOS) 
or command line (Windows): flake8

The file setup.cfg in the root of the repository contains the settings used to generate the report.
